	  <p id="aboutus"><span id="ourname">Our Company History</span>
		<br /><br /><span id="ourname">Made in Mississippi Marketplace LLC</span> was founded on June 3, 2011 with a vision of marketing and advertising local products, to be "all about everything Mississippi."  The <span id="ourname">Mississippi BBQ Trail</span> is the first in that series of products created by Mr. Jim Hatten.<br /><br />This website is one component of a promotion campaign to bring the message about Mississippi barbecue to a wider audience, people traveling and living throughout the Southern Diamond:  the geographical region from Memphis to Dallas to New Orleans to Atlanta.<br /><br />The <span id="ourname">Mississippi BBQ Trail</span> invites local residents and tourists travelling through our fair state to visit and be patrons of these interesting and colourful BBQ Joints all over Mississippi.<br /><br />Why did I develop the <span id="ourname">Mississippi BBQ Trail</span> campaign?<br /><br />Several years ago, I was considering the challenge of building a barbecue grill in a 5,000 gallon steel fuel tank.  That same week, I happened across an article that described the feral hog epidemic in the southern U.S.  I wondered if the solutions discussed in the article could be brought to Mississippi, where there is now an overpopulation of feral hogs damaging our farm and ranch lands.  The article described how the State of Texas has created a pathway so farmers and ranchers can trap and get to market what is considered to be excellent barbecue meat.<br /><br />I imagined having all that great barbecuing going on and thought “people in Mississippi can eat a lot of pork.”  How much?  The next question was the inspiration:  how big is the retail barbecue business in Mississippi?  My research highlighted a rich and diverse industry with an important economic footprint.  I also found that this particular industry segment did not have a strong online presence.  Tourists and local residents should be able to easily find a good place for lunch or dinner at a Mississippi BBQ Joint from a reliable online source.<br /><br />The <span id="ourname">Mississippi BBQ Trail</span> will provide a fun way to find your favorite ribs while traveling through our great state.  There is no question, you’re going to get some good food and meet some interesting people.<br /><br />Please follow us as we expand and diversify our media coverage and take this message of great bar-b-q to a larger audience.  And what about the feral hog epidemic?  I think we can find a way to help with that - let's get the grill going!<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Jim Hatten

	<p id="ethics">The <span id="ourname">Mississippi BBQ Trail</span> has adopted the <span id="ourname">American Marketing Association Code of Ethics</span> to guide our people and our company in all aspects of our business.<br />James A. Hatten<br /><br /><br />
	<span id="ourname">Ethical Norms and Values for Marketers</span><br /><br /><a href="https://archive.ama.org/Archive/AboutAMA/Pages/Statement%20of%20Ethics.aspx" target="_blank">AMA Code of Ethics</a><br /><br />
 PREAMBLE<br /><br />
The American Marketing Association commits itself to promoting the highest standard of professional ethical norms and values for its members (practitioners, academics and students). Norms are established standards of conduct that are expected and maintained by society and/or professional organizations. Values represent the collective conception of what communities find desirable, important and morally proper. Values also serve as the criteria for evaluating our own personal actions and the actions of others. As marketers, we recognize that we not only serve our organizations but also act as stewards of society in creating, facilitating and executing the transactions that are part of the greater economy. In this role, marketers are expected to embrace the highest professional ethical norms and the ethical values implied by our responsibility toward multiple stakeholders (e.g., customers, employees, investors, peers, channel members, regulators and the host community).<br /><br />

<span id="ourname">ETHICAL NORMS</span><br /><br />
As Marketers, we must:<br /><br />

Do no harm. This means consciously avoiding harmful actions or omissions by embodying high ethical standards and adhering to all applicable laws and regulations in the choices we make.<br /><br />
Foster trust in the marketing system. This means striving for good faith and fair dealing so as to contribute toward the efficacy of the exchange process as well as avoiding deception in product design, pricing, communication, and delivery of distribution. <br /><br />
Embrace ethical values. This means building relationships and enhancing consumer confidence in the integrity of marketing by affirming these core values: honesty, responsibility, fairness, respect, transparency and citizenship.<br /><br />

<span id="ourname">ETHICAL VALUES</span><br /><br />
<span id="ourname">Honesty</span> – to be forthright in dealings with customers and stakeholders.  To this end, we will:<br /><br />

Strive to be truthful in all situations and at all times.
Offer products of value that do what we claim in our communications.
Stand behind our products if they fail to deliver their claimed benefits.
Honor our explicit and implicit commitments and promises.<br /><br />

<span id="ourname">Responsibility</span> – to accept the consequences of our marketing decisions and strategies.  To this end, we will:<br /><br />

Strive to serve the needs of customers.
Avoid using coercion with all stakeholders.
Acknowledge the social obligations to stakeholders that come with increased marketing and economic power.
Recognize our special commitments to vulnerable market segments such as children, seniors, the economically impoverished, market illiterates and others who may be substantially disadvantaged.
Consider environmental stewardship in our decision-making.<br /><br />

<span id="ourname">Fairness</span> – to balance justly the needs of the buyer with the interests of the seller.  To this end, we will:<br /><br />

Represent products in a clear way in selling, advertising and other forms of communication; this includes the avoidance of false, misleading and deceptive promotion.
Reject manipulations and sales tactics that harm customer trust. 
Refuse to engage in price fixing, predatory pricing, price gouging or “bait-and-switch” tactics.
Avoid knowing participation in conflicts of interest.
Seek to protect the private information of customers, employees and partners.<br /><br />

<span id="ourname">Respect</span> – to acknowledge the basic human dignity of all stakeholders.  To this end, we will:<br /><br />

Value individual differences and avoid stereotyping customers or depicting demographic groups (e.g., gender, race, sexual orientation) in a negative or dehumanizing way.
Listen to the needs of customers and make all reasonable efforts to monitor and improve their satisfaction on an ongoing basis.
Make every effort to understand and respectfully treat buyers, suppliers, intermediaries and distributors from all cultures.
Acknowledge the contributions of others, such as consultants, employees and coworkers, to marketing endeavors.
Treat everyone, including our competitors, as we would wish to be treated.<br /><br />

<span id="ourname">Transparency</span> – to create a spirit of openness in marketing operations. To this end, we will:<br /><br />

Strive to communicate clearly with all constituencies.
Accept constructive criticism from customers and other stakeholders.
Explain and take appropriate action regarding significant product or service risks, component substitutions or other foreseeable eventualities that could affect customers or their perception of the purchase decision.
Disclose list prices and terms of financing as well as available price deals and adjustments.<br /><br />

<span id="ourname">Citizenship</span> – to fulfill the economic, legal, philanthropic and societal responsibilities that serve stakeholders.  To this end, we will:<br /><br />

Strive to protect the ecological environment in the execution of marketing campaigns.
Give back to the community through volunteerism and charitable donations. 
Contribute to the overall betterment of marketing and its reputation. 
Urge supply chain members to ensure that trade is fair for all participants, including producers in developing countries.<br /><br />

IMPLEMENTATION<br /><br />
We expect AMA members to be courageous and proactive in leading and/or aiding their organizations in the fulfillment of the explicit and implicit promises made to those stakeholders. We recognize that every industry sector and marketing sub-discipline (e.g., marketing research, e-commerce, Internet selling, direct marketing, and advertising) has its own specific ethical issues that require policies and commentary. An array of such codes can be accessed through links on the AMA Web site. Consistent with the principle of subsidiarity (solving issues at the level where the expertise resides), we encourage all such groups to develop and/or refine their industry and discipline-specific codes of ethics to supplement these guiding ethical norms and values.</p>
